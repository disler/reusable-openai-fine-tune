### Reasons to fine-tune
1. Consistency in specific outputs
   - Fine-tuning adjusts the model's internal weights, leading to more reliable and predictable responses across similar tasks
2. Handling complex or domain-specific tasks
   - When your application requires deep understanding of specialized fields, fine-tuning can significantly improve performance
3. Improved token efficiency
   - Fine-tuned models often require shorter prompts, reducing token usage and potentially lowering costs
4. Better performance on long outputs
   - Fine-tuning helps maintain coherence and adherence to instructions throughout longer generations
5. Overcoming limitations of prompt engineering
   - If you've tried structured outputs, have several examples, and are still not getting the results you're looking for, fine-tuning can force more consistent behavior across tasks

### Reasons not to fine-tune
1. When prompt engineering can achieve desired results
   - If you can get satisfactory performance through careful prompt design, fine-tuning may be unnecessary
2. For tasks that require quick iteration and feedback
   - Fine-tuning has a longer feedback loop compared to prompt engineering, making rapid experimentation more difficult
3. When the task doesn't require specialized knowledge
   - For general tasks where the base model's knowledge is sufficient, fine-tuning may not provide significant benefits

### When to use fine-tuning ([from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning))
Fine-tuning OpenAI text generation models can make them better for specific applications, but it requires a careful investment of time and effort. We recommend first attempting to get good results with prompt engineering, prompt chaining (breaking complex tasks into multiple prompts), and function calling, with the key reasons being:

- There are many tasks at which our models may not initially appear to perform well, but results can be improved with the right prompts - thus fine-tuning may not be necessary
- Iterating over prompts and other tactics has a much faster feedback loop than iterating with fine-tuning, which requires creating datasets and running training jobs
- In cases where fine-tuning is still necessary, initial prompt engineering work is not wasted - we typically see best results when using a good prompt in the fine-tuning data (or combining prompt chaining / tool use with fine-tuning)
- Our prompt engineering guide provides a background on some of the most effective strategies and tactics for getting better performance without fine-tuning. You may find it helpful to iterate quickly on prompts in our playground.

### When to use fine-tuning ([from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fine-tune-claude-3-haiku))

#### Overview of fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is a popular technique to improve model performance. By creating a customized version of the model, you can train the model to excel at highly tailored workflows.

To fine-tune Claude 3 Haiku, you first prepare a set of high quality prompt-completion pairsâ€”the ideal outputs that you want Claude to provide for a given task. The fine-tuning API, now available in preview, will use your data to create your own custom Claude 3 Haiku. Using the Amazon Bedrock console or API, you can test and refine your custom Claude 3 Haiku model until it meets your performance goals and is ready for deployment.

#### Benefits

Fine-tuning allows you to customize Claude 3 Haiku so it can acquire specialized business knowledge, leading to improved accuracy and consistency. Benefits include:

- Better results on specialized tasks: Enhance performance for domain-specific actions such as classification, interactions with custom APIs, or industry-specific data interpretation. Fine-tuning allows Claude 3 Haiku to excel in areas crucial to your business compared to more general models by encoding company and domain knowledge.

- Faster speeds at lower cost: Reduce costs for production deployments where Claude 3 Haiku can be used in place of Sonnet or Opus, while also returning results faster.

- Consistent, brand-aligned formatting: Generate consistently structured outputs tailored to your exact specifications like standardized reports or custom schemas, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal protocols.

### When to use fine-tuning ([from Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/model-tuning))

Fine-tuning with the Gemini API

Fine-tuning can improve your model's performance on specific tasks or help the model adhere to specific output requirements when instructions aren't sufficient and you have a set of examples that demonstrate the desired outputs.

When to use fine-tuning:

1. When prompt design strategies like few-shot prompting don't produce the results you need.

2. For improving performance on specific tasks.

3. To help the model adhere to specific output requirements.

4. When you have a set of examples demonstrating the outputs you want.

5. For niche tasks where significant improvements can be achieved with a modest number of examples.

6. To teach the model to mimic wanted behavior or tasks by providing many illustrative examples.

7. When you need to encode additional information for performing specific tasks or behaviors.

8. For tasks requiring high-quality, diverse, and representative examples of real inputs and outputs.

9. When your application needs consistent formatting, keywords, instructions, or information in both training and production data.

10. If you need to improve model performance for specialized tasks like classification, interactions with custom APIs, or industry-specific data interpretation.

11. To reduce costs and increase speed in production deployments.

12. For generating consistently structured outputs tailored to exact specifications, ensuring compliance with requirements and protocols.
